<em>In addition to researching, writing copy, + designing the website, I also created the illustrations using Figma</em></p>

<em>To showcase resources, I created cards with a short description and an illustration that corresponded to the section theme and the site&#39;s brand</em></p>
<p>In addition to designing the site, I also wrote all the copy, did all the research and coded it myself. It&#39;s still a work in progress, but I&#39;m continually adding, refining and researching and expanding.</p>
