        <h4> 2020</h4>
        <p>After stumbling across <a href="https://passwords.ai/">this</a> website documenting the work of a group of artists, designers, and technologists creating speculative authentication methods, I became intrigued. Although they used machine learning in their implementations, I was curious whether I could implement a method that doesn&#39;t use machine learning, but still bypasses the traditional word password model.</p>
<p>After playing with color as a password, I changed my approach to using pixel art as a speculative authentication method. Still very much a work in progress (particularly around encryption/hashing/salting/security), but an intriguing exercise in reimagining how we authenticate ourselves online and wondering the possible &quot;what ifs&quot; around it.</p>

<em>Users can select a sequence of tiles anywhere from 5 to 25. The text on the right will alert the user when they&#39;ve used too many tiles.</em></p>
<p>As a designer + artist, I would definitely describe myself as visually inclined. I thought that an authentication method that focused on a visual implementation could be useful in more playful applications, such as a game or other interactive application. </p>
