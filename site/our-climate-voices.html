        <h4> 2021</h4>
        <p>Our Climate Voices is a grassroots climate justice organization that focuses on amplifying the climate narratives of those who have been traditionally left out of mainstream media. I joined the team in June 2020 as a digital content fellow. </p>
<p>One of the first things I did on the team was to audit the accessibility compliance of our website and digital content. We have a pretty vibrant color pallet, but I noticed that not all color combinations we used were optimized for accessibility - particularly important since we are a social justice org. Using <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a>, I drafted a best practices strategy for our color combinations moving forward. </p>

<p>Other core work I&#39;ve done at OCV is around designing content (in collaboration with the rest of the OCV team) for social media. With a following of over 18k on Instagram, the content we put out is seen by a lot of eyes. (For examples of OCV&#39;s social media, please visit OCV&#39;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ourclimatevoices/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ourclimatevoices">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Climate__Voices">Twitter</a> pages). </p>

<p>Other projects include producing <a href="https://www.ourclimatevoices.org/2020/sheila">video content</a>, maintaining OCV&#39;s squarespace site and I&#39;m currently developing an interactive web application as a companion piece to OCV&#39;s forthcoming documentary, <a href="https://www.ourclimatevoices.org/pioc">Police in Our Climate.</a></p>
