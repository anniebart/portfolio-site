        <h4> 2021</h4>
        <p>snail mail is a speculative design for a communication product that uses the timing of traditional, physical mail, for delivery. </p>

<p>Instead of the near instantaneous delivery of a text, an email, a slack message, snail mail, as the name might suggest, is all about slowness. </p>
<p>Maybe while reading this, your phone has buzzed or vibrated or you got a desktop notification or some other alert signaling that a person, or a company or a bot, has communicated something to you.While quick communication facilitates all sorts of great (and important!) things, a lot of our communication doesn&#39;t need to compete for our immediate attention. </p>

<p><em>Some examples of snail mail&#39;s UI</em></p>
<p>Drawing from the late 90s/early 00&#39;s aesthetic, snail mail hints at a time when the immediacy of the internet was not taken for granted (anyone who had dial up would understand...)</p>

<p><em>Looking to AOL and other 90s user interfaces as inspiration</em></p>
<p>snail mail also looks to <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/">light phone</a> as an example of light weight UIs - just the essentials without feature bloating or overboard UIs. </p>
<p>While snail mail currently lives primarily in a figma file, the skeleton of code lives on <a href="https://github.com/anniebart/snail-mail">github</a> and will be finished....one day. </p>
