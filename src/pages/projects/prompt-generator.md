While at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about), I've been a part of the creative group. One week, we decided to do a mini "Hack and tell" and create something in a 20 minute span. I decided to go with a [prompt generator](https://anniebart-prompt-generator.glitch.me/) - something to give me prompts for creative coding projects so I don't become stuck with choice paralysis.

I ended up spending a bit more time than 20 minutes on this,styling the prompt generator after the terminal, where users enter commands to either receive prompts, get the manual or "man" page, or clear the console.
