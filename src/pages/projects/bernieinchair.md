After Biden's inauguration, there was one image that stood out above the rest: [Bernie Sanders sitting in a chair](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/23/bernie-sanders-inauguration-meme-heres-the-story-behind-the-photo.html) with his arms crossed and large mittens covering his hands. 

Memes quickly covered social media, with images of Bernie in the chair and unusual backgrounds popping up quicker than daisies. Inspired by this, I made a quick [site](https://mixolydian-crocus-chronometer.glitch.me/) where users can put Bernie in a few pre-selected backgrounds or be bold and add their own background.
