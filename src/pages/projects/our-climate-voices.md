Our Climate Voices is a grassroots climate justice organization that focuses on amplifying the climate narratives of those who have been traditionally left out of mainstream media. I joined the team in June 2020 as a digital content fellow. 

One of the first things I did on the team was to audit the accessibility compliance of our website and digital content. We have a pretty vibrant color pallet, but I noticed that not all color combinations we used were optimized for accessibility - particularly important since we are a social justice org. Using [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), I drafted a best practices strategy for our color combinations moving forward.

Other core work I do at OCV is around designing content in conjunction with the rest of the OCV team for social media. With a following of over 18k, the content we put out is seen by a lot of eyes. (For examples of OCV's social media, please visit OCV's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ourclimatevoices/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ourclimatevoices) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Climate__Voices) pages).

Other projects include producing [video content](https://www.ourclimatevoices.org/2020/sheila), maintaining OCV's squarespace site and I'm currently developing an interactive web application as a companion piece to OCV's forthcoming documentary, [Police in Our Climate.](https://www.ourclimatevoices.org/pioc).
