Like a lot of people, I've found myself spending more and more time on my computer since the pandemic has started. I built [this](https://plain-zippy-jersey.glitch.me/) to remind myself to take breaks to focus, not on my work, but on my breath.

A user will enter in the amount of time they wish to focus or meditate for and then the timer begins its countdown. If the user moves the mouse, the timer will reset and then begin the countdown again.

Can you make it all the way without resetting? How long can you maintain focus?
