In 2021, I was selected as the [2021 RARE with Google Creative Fellow, Product Design](https://rare.withgoogle.com/program/creative-fellowship/) on the Material Design team, focusing on ux + visual design. 

During my time there, I contributed to a variety of projects, including the launch of M3 (aka Material You) as the design point-of-contact for [buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) + developing the [color application for interaction states](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction-states). I also illustrated one of Material's [blog posts on product localization.](https://material.io/blog/localization-principles-techniques).
