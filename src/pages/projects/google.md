In 2021, I was selected as the [2021 RARE with Google Creative Fellow, Product Design](https://rare.withgoogle.com/program/creative-fellowship/) on the Material Design team, focusing on ux + visual design. 

Some of the things I've worked on: 
- [Principles and Techniques for Effective Localization](https://material.io/blog/localization-principles-techniques)
- [Common buttons (design point-of-contact for assets, specs, behavior, + tokens)](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview)
- [M3 Interaction States (design point of contact)](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction-states)
