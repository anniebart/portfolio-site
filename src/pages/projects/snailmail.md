snail mail is a speculative design for a communication product that uses the timing of traditional, physical mail, for delivery.

Instead of the near instantaneous delivery of a text, an email, a slack message, snail mail, as the name might suggest, is all about slowness. 


Maybe while reading this, your phone has buzzed or vibrated or you got a desktop notification or some other alert signaling that a person, or a company or a bot, has communicated something to you.While quick communication facilitates all sorts of great (and important!) things, a lot of our communication doesn't need to compete for our immediate attention.

*Some examples of snail mail's UI*



Drawing from the late 90s/early 00's aesthetic, snail mail hints at a time when the immediacy of the internet was not taken for granted (anyone who had dial up would understand...)

*Looking to AOL and other 90s user interfaces as inspiration*

snail mail also looks to [light phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) as an example of light weight UIs - just the essentials without feature bloating or overboard UIs. 

While snail mail currently lives primarily in a figma file, the skeleton of code lives on [github](https://github.com/anniebart/snail-mail) and will be finished....one day.
